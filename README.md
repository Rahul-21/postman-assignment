Question to be answered:

Given the sales transaction data we want to assess the performance of the company. Is the company's performance improving or degrading over time? Examine and highlight important trends visible in the sales data and insights.  Also, how can we measure our performance in terms of customer acquisition and building customer loyalty? What kind of customer do typically buy from us? Identify relationships and drivers of sales that might be hidden in the dataset. Can we take some initiatives based on the data to increase the sales? Also mention, based on data can we avoid out of stock situations?


To answer, first give an overview of the data, then go on to formalise the question(s) you want to answer. Mention your approach(metrics/visualizations/analysis) to answer the above questions. Explain why you chose the metrics/visualizations/analysis you chose and how will it help to answer the questions raised. In addition, explain why it is important to track this metric for the business. Finally, present the analysis with metrics, visualizations and insights answering the questions. Also mention any sort of data cleansing you had to do (if any).

The expected output is a google slide/ppt containing the overall structure including questions, reasonings, visualizations & insights around the analysis.
